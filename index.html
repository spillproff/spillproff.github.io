            Finally, we have arrived to what I wanted this site to be. Some sort of online portfolio and my public sticky note site.
            <br><br> 
            Why does this site even exist you ask? It was a test.
            <br><br>
            Originally when the first version of the site came out, it had been around 5 years since I even touched HTML and CSS so I wanted to see if I could be able to create a new site almost by myself. Of course, I used some online tutorials and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools.com</a>.
            <br><br>
            Once again... except some tabs are new.
            <br><br>
            <a href="directory.html">Directory</a> is basically a way to view almost every page on the site. I originally intended "Projects", Videos" and "Notes" to be on the navigation bar but it wouldn't work right for mobile users or people with low resolutions. This means this site is mobile friendly! Thankfully, took a while to figure out what to do.
            <br><br>
            <a href="links.html">Links</a> is similar to directory but it sends you to pages outside the website; my other social medias are there.
            <br><br>
            <a href="about.html">About</a> tells you a bit more about me. Most of it isn't even that important. There's only one important story to tell about myself and how I got my name.
            <br><br>
            Lastly, I wanted to do articles, mini-stories and sticky notes on here. Since GitHub has a repository limit of 1 gigabyte, I'll limit how many of each will be on here.
            <br><br>
            <ul>
                <li>15 articles on the site at a given time.</li>
                <li>1 story per day. (want to do daily stores just to get my mind working each day, hoping to get better at story telling)</li>
                <li>30-50 sticky notes on the site at a given time. (I put 30-50 as I didn't do a stress test on how big the files would be)</li>
            </ul><br>
            And I guess that's it. Alright, see ya around!
