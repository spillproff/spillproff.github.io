            I've seem to figure out how to use HTML again. It was pretty hard but I didn't want to use any old code since most of it I didn't understand and plus, it was super messy. This version of the site is more simplistic to fit my new style of my logo along with my YouTube.
            
            <br><br>

            So, here we go again with introductions...

            <br><br>

            The projects page will be used for any games or files I publish. This will include game demos, free games, Source maps and mods.

            <br><br>

            The videos page... isn't even a page, it's a link to my YouTube channel.
            
            <br><br>

            The about page is self-explanatory, unless you don't know what about means, which then I don't know what to do about that; I'm not much of a teacher.

            <br><br>
            Lastly, what are these notes? Well, these will be kind of like journal entries. I don't know how often I'll update them, maybe every other day. I'll explain what happened that day and what I did or it might just be a thought. The note can be as simple as a single sentence and as complex as several paragraphs.

            <br><br>

            Anyway, that's all!
